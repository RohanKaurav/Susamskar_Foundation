        Founded in 2013, Susamskar Foundation is a registered non-profit social initiative aims from the vision of a large section of dedicated teachers and professionals from Dhrangadhra, united by a shared commitment to shaping positive futures through value-based education and community development.

        What began as a focused initiative slowly matured with like-minded educators, volunteers, and thought leaders across cities, towns, villages, traditions, and communities focusing together. We approached a diverse range of populations, from rural communities to urban centers, ensuring that our programs reach those who need them most.
